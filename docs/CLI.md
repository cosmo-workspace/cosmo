# cosmoctl

A command line utirities to manage COSMO resources.
It is able to do the same thing +Î± with COSMO Dashboard by CLI.

## Difference with COSMO Dashboard 
COSMO Dashboard has the own authentication but cosmoctl use Kubernetes RBAC for authentication.

It is because all of the COSMO resources are Kubernetes resources actually.
Even if one who uses COSMO User is not `cosmo-admin` in COSMO auhtentication,  COSMO User auhtentication is meanless when he/she is granted as `cluster-admin` in Kubernetes RBAC and can access all Kubernetes resources by Kubectl.

This means `cosmoctl` can create COSMO User (Kubernetes Namespace, acctually) even if there is NO User in COSMO Dashboard.
